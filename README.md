# myNeuralNetwork
Trained and tested Neural Network with Numpy data arrays

## 
Used input information from "Building_AI" corse Exercise 21 and adopted to Backpropagation example of NN from https://dev.to/shamdasani/buiild-a-flexible.... 

Exercise 21 network consits of 5 input nodes, a hidden layer with two nodes, second hidden layer with two nodes and finally output node
