# myNeuralNetwork
Trained and tested Neural Network with Numpy data arrays

## About the Code
This Neural Network consits of 5 input nodes, two hidden layers and output node.
First hidden layer consists of two nodes. Second hidden layer consists of two nodes as well.

Data consists of Numpy arrays, representing real estate parameters and final values.
Date has been run through ForwardPropagation to train the NN and to obtain coefficients.
Finally BackPropagation function has been defined. New data and coefficient from training data have been run through BackPropagation to obtain results i.e Real Estate price predictions.

Used input information from "Building_AI" course, Exercise 21 - "Neural Networks" (course developed by University of Helsinky and Reactor) and adopted to Backpropagation example of NN from https://dev.to/shamdasani/buiild-a-flexible....
